// Section: 3.4 Simple Inheritance
// Exercise: 1
// Description: Test file to test colon syntax
// The colon syntax can improve the performance of constructors.
// To test this, make sure that you print some text in the pointâ€™s constructors, destructor
//  and also the assignment operator.
// Now, execute the following code in the test program
//  and count the number of point constructor, destructor and assignment calls:
//      Line l;
// Now, change the constructors in the Line class to use the colon syntax
//  to set the start- and end-point data members and run the test program again.
// Is the number of point constructor, destructor and assignment calls less than before?
// Apply the colon syntax also for the Point class constructors and if applicable also for the Circle class.

    //  Assignment operator not called.
